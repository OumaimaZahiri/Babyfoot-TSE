This application provides an assistance to the arbitration of foosball matches as part of a group project created by 5 people : Maxime Boichon, Cl√©ment Bourlet, Enguerran De Larocque Latour, Ilyas Tibari and myself (Oumaima Zahiri).

The frontend was basically coded with JavaFX (we used SceneBuilder to make the interface management easier).
The backend, in particular the image analysis, was managed by opencv.
We used Maven to automate basically the dependencies on external modules and components (for instance opencv) and facilitate its importation on other
devices.
